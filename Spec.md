## FoodChain Specification

## Any good software starts off with: Why?
We choose to tackle the problem of food chain transparency because:

- **Addressing Real-World Issues:**  
  - Combat food fraud and contamination, a concern for millions of people around the world.  
  - Decrase supply shortages.
  
- **Technical Solution:**  
  - Leverage blockchain technology to secure and verify data.  

- **Enhancing Sustainability:**  
  - Promote ethical practices by improving transparency in sourcing.  

- **Supporting Stakeholders:**  
  - Equip farmers, distributors, and retailers with real-time insights.  


## How?
FoodChain is built on a robust, multi-tiered architecture that follows industry-standard software practices:
- **Requirements:** Meticulous identification of system needs for traceability, security, and usability.

- **Design:** A complex integration of a Svelte-based web client and a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
    - Network flow:

- **Implementation:** Modular, scalable, and easy to integrate code using best practices to handle complex supply chain operations.
    - All systems are hosted on a secure and scalable infrastructure.

    - We implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline to streamline development and deployment.

    - We adopted rigorous formatting standards inspired by industry-leading practices.

    - We ensured compatibility with existing software and technologies throughout our process.

- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration testing using:
    - Postman: For API testing to simulate and validate RESTful endpoints

    - Github Actions: Built custom workflows to test our Blockchain integration
    
    - Hyperledger Fabric Network Testing
